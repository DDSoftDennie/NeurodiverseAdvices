        <h3>What is Neurodiversity?</h3>
        <p>
          Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in human brain function and cognitive traits.
          It includes autism, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia, Tourette syndrome, and more.
          These are not deficits — they are different ways of experiencing and interacting with the world.

              <li>Protect non-negotiable recharge time after high-demand events (no guilt required).</li>
              <li>Build in transition time between activities; rapid context-switching is especially costly.</li>
              <li>Identify your "easy wins" — tasks or contexts that reliably feel energising — and schedule these when depleted.</li>
              <li>Say no strategically: declining a social obligation early costs less energy than masking through it.</li>
              <li>Use stimming freely in private spaces — research confirms it reduces anxiety and improves focus.</li>
              <li>Batch difficult tasks with your peak cognitive window (know whether you are a morning or evening person — ADHD often involves delayed sleep phase).</li>

              📚 <strong>Research:</strong> Petrolini et al. (2023) confirmed that cognitive and emotional fatigue in autistic adults is neurologically distinct from tiredness and requires rest that neurotypical recovery strategies do not fully address.

            <p class="advice-intro">ADHD is a difference in dopamine and noradrenaline regulation, not a willpower deficit. Strategies that work with your brain's reward system are far more effective than willpower-based approaches.</p>
            <ul class="advice-list">
              <li>Use <strong>body doubling</strong> — working alongside another person (even on video) increases focus for many with ADHD.</li>
              <li>Externalise your working memory: write everything down immediately, use visual cues, leave objects in sight as reminders.</li>
              <li>Break tasks into the smallest possible units and start with just two minutes.</li>
              <li>Use timers and the Pomodoro technique (25 min on, 5 min off) to make time concrete and visible.</li>
              <li>Exercise before demanding cognitive tasks — it temporarily raises dopamine and noradrenaline levels.</li>
              <li>Pair boring tasks with something enjoyable (background music, podcast, walking).</li>
              <li>Acknowledge hyperfocus as a superpower and a risk — set external alarms to transition out of it.</li>
              <li>Consider medication evaluation — stimulant medications have the strongest evidence base of any psychiatric medication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="research-note">
              📚 <strong>Research:</strong> Barkley (2015) characterises ADHD as primarily a deficit in executive function and self-regulation, not attention — reframing this changes what support is effective.

            <p class="advice-intro">Masking (camouflaging autistic traits to appear neurotypical) is linked to exhaustion, depression, anxiety, and a delayed sense of identity. Reducing masking is a key goal of autistic wellbeing.</p>
            <ul class="advice-list">
              <li>Notice when you are masking — facial expressions "performed", suppressed stimming, scripted responses — and ask yourself if it is truly necessary.</li>
              <li>Find at least one safe space or person where you can be unmasked, even briefly.</li>
              <li>Give yourself permission to stim in public — it is a human neurological need, not a sign of disorder.</li>
              <li>Seek out autistic community (online forums, local groups) — peer connection is protective against depression.</li>
              <li>Recognise that late diagnosis is common, especially in women and non-binary people (historically under-diagnosed). Your experiences are valid regardless of formal diagnosis.</li>
              <li>Process past experiences with a neurodiversity-affirming therapist — many autistic adults carry significant grief around late diagnosis.</li>
              <li>Reframe your traits as a different operating system, not a broken one.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="research-note">
              📚 <strong>Research:</strong> Cage & Troxell-Whitman (2019) found that autistic people who masked more had significantly higher rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Reduced masking correlates with improved wellbeing.

            <ul class="advice-list">
              <li>Use text-to-speech tools (Natural Reader, built-in OS readers) to access written material without decoding effort.</li>
              <li>Use speech-to-text for writing tasks — removes the transcription bottleneck so ideas can flow.</li>
              <li>Try coloured overlays or background colours when reading (some people find cream or pale yellow reduces visual stress).</li>
              <li>Use mind maps and visual diagrams instead of linear note-taking.</li>
              <li>For maths: use manipulatives, calculators, and visual representations freely — arithmetic fluency is not the same as mathematical ability.</li>
              <li>Break reading tasks into smaller chunks and use a finger or ruler to track lines.</li>

            <p class="advice-intro">Anxiety and depression affect around 50% of autistic adults and 40% of those with ADHD — far above population rates. These are largely environmentally driven and highly treatable.</p>
            <ul class="advice-list">
              <li>Distinguish between sensory-driven anxiety and generalised anxiety — they require different responses.</li>
              <li>Recognise autistic burnout early: persistent exhaustion, loss of skills, emotional flatness after sustained effort.</li>
              <li>Prioritise sleep rigorously — sleep disruption exacerbates every other symptom dramatically.</li>
              <li>Use structured routines as an anxiety-management tool, not just for productivity.</li>
              <li>Practice interoceptive awareness — body scanning, noticing hunger, temperature, tension — to build emotional awareness.</li>
              <li>Seek neurodiversity-affirming therapy (ACT and CBT adapted for autism have the strongest evidence base).</li>
              <li>Connect with others who understand: online communities (Autistic Self Advocacy Network, ADHD subreddits) offer validation that is often unavailable in daily life.</li>

              📚 <strong>Research:</strong> Lai et al. (2019) found that anxiety in autistic people is largely driven by living in environments built for neurotypical people — with social support, rates can be significantly reduced.

              <li>Recognise the signs of unhealthy relationships: those who exploit your rule-following nature, high tolerance for discomfort, or difficulty reading manipulation.</li>
              <li>Use scripts for common social situations if they reduce anxiety — this is a strategy, not a failure to be authentic.</li>
              <li>Understand that post-social exhaustion is neurological, not introversion — communicate this to partners and friends.</li>
